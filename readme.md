**Fourothree-theme** is a node package for [Frontity](https://community.frontity.org/) based on 403page.com. It started it's life as TwentyTwenty, an incredible port of the default Wordpress theme for Frontity by [Segun Adebayo](https://twitter.com/thesegunadebayo).

**IMPORTANT STUFF TO CHANGE:**
  - The logo is set in */src/components/header.js*
  - The Instagram, Gmail and Twitter links are set in */src/components/footer.js*. Same for the plain text email address.
  - There's PLENTY more to do, including optimisations, cleanup, addition of more features. Suggestions are welcome.

**TO INSTALL:**
Run this in your Frontity project:
```
npm i @403page/fourothree-theme --save
```
Then update your frontity.settings.js so that the package name is `fourothree-theme` (instead of whichever theme is set there already).
